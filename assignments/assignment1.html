        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project explores why concerts feel more crowded than ever by turning a data-driven explanation into
          a comic-style narrative. Using real live-music revenue data and a series of illustrated scenes, the comic
          blends storytelling, humor, and charts to explain how post-pandemic demand, long-term industry growth,
          and cultural shifts all converge in the current live-music boom.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- The Story -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          The comic follows two friends attending several concerts in Toronto in 2025 — from Kylie Minogue to
          Kendrick Lamar &amp; SZA and Coldplay. At every show, they keep noticing the same thing:
          <em>“OMG, it’s so crowded!”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Their conversation becomes the narrative spine of the piece. As they react to the crowd, they gradually
          introduce real data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>how global live-music revenues grew before and after the pandemic,</li>
          <li>why touring has become a primary source of income for artists,</li>
          <li>and how streaming, social media, and generational preferences all push people towards live experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By the final panels, the characters realize that what feels like a post-pandemic exception is actually the
          visible part of a long-running structural trend in the live-music industry.

      <!-- Data & Insight -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Data &amp; Key Insight</h2>
        <p>
          The charts embedded in the comic highlight two main ideas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The rebound effect after COVID-19.</strong> There is a visible spike in global live-music revenues
            in the years immediately after the pandemic, as audiences return to concerts and festivals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The long-term structural growth.</strong> When looking at a longer time span (2004–2025), live-music
            revenues have been growing steadily for years. COVID-19 appears more as a temporary setback than the main
            cause of the trend.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The key insight:
          <em>
            crowded concerts are not just a “post-COVID” phenomenon. They are the outcome of long-term shifts in how music
            is produced, monetized, and experienced.
          </em>
        </p>

      <!-- Creative Process -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Creative Process</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Concept and narrative framing.</strong></p>
        <p>
          I started with a simple question – <em>“Why are all my concerts so packed?”</em> – and decided to answer it
          through a comic rather than a traditional dashboard. The goal was to make the explanation feel personal, visual,
          and emotionally relatable.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Storyboarding.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Before designing any final panel, I sketched a storyboard that defined the main scenes, where the charts would
          appear, and how the dialogue would introduce each data point. This helped control pacing: setting up the problem,
          revealing the data, and landing the conclusion without overwhelming readers.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Visual design and illustration.</strong></p>
        <p>
          I used a colorful, comic-book aesthetic — speech bubbles, sound effects, strong contrasts and crowd silhouettes —
          to create an energetic atmosphere. The characters act as guides, reacting to the environment and asking the
          questions that the audience might have.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. Data integration.</strong></p>
        <p>
          The charts are embedded inside the comic as part of the world: a panel becomes a graph, a speech bubble points
          to a revenue curve, and annotations highlight key years. This keeps the data present without breaking the
          narrative flow.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Assembly and refinement.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Once the panels, charts, and text were ready, I arranged them vertically so the piece works as a scrolling
          experience. I edited the dialogue to keep it concise and focused on the main story: from crowded venues to the
          bigger picture of the live-music industry.
        </p>

      <!-- Tools -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Canva</strong> – comic layout, illustration composition, speech bubbles, and visual effects.<br />
          <strong>Flourish</strong> – creation of the bar/column charts for global live-music revenues.<br />
          <strong>Storyboard sketches &amp; drawing tools</strong> – to plan pacing, panel sequence, and data placement.<br />
          <strong>Image editing tools</strong> (e.g., GIMP/Photoshop) – minor color and layout adjustments.
        </p>

      <!-- Reflection -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment helped me practice translating quantitative analysis into a narrative format that feels
          approachable and memorable. In particular, I learned how to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use characters and dialogue to make complex trends more intuitive.</li>
          <li>Integrate charts into a visual story world without losing readability.</li>
          <li>Balance aesthetics and clarity so the piece is fun to read but still analytically grounded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, this project is a strong example of how I combine analytical thinking with creative visual storytelling
          to communicate insights in ways that people actually remember.
