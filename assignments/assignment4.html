    <!-- RIGHT: SCROLLING CASE STUDY CONTENT -->
    <section class="case-content">

      <!-- Overview -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          RoboStory is a horror-inspired data narrative about artificial intelligence and work. In this story, Robo is
          not just a cute robot — he represents AI systems that “eat” tasks and occupations as they become more capable.
          His appetite grows with the amount of data and automation we feed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project explores how this dynamic affects workers in Canada, especially those in midlife who suddenly find
          their jobs exposed to automation and face pressure to reskill or change careers. The story connects national
          statistics with the specific context of Durham Region, where the course is based.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Who or What is Robo? -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Who or What is Robo?</h2>
        <p>
          In the narrative, Robo embodies artificial intelligence itself. His constant hunger stands for the growing
          number of professions that AI can partially or fully replace, particularly higher-skilled jobs that rely on
          cognitive, analytical, or information-processing tasks. As Robo evolves, he needs more data and more tasks to
          keep “feeding” and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story emphasizes that midlife workers are in a vulnerable position: they often have specialized
          experience, mortgages, and family responsibilities, but may not have the time or resources to rapidly retrain
          when AI reshapes their occupations.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Data & Methods -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Data &amp; Analytical Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The narrative is grounded in a Statistics Canada study that estimates exposure to artificial intelligence
          across Canadian occupations. The study shows that highly skilled roles can be both the most at risk of
          disruption and the most likely to benefit from AI as a complement, rather than a simple replacement. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>
        <p>
          To translate this into Robo’s “preferences”, we used the exposure index to distinguish the jobs that Robo
          likes the most (high exposure) and the ones he likes the least (low exposure), creating a visual quadrant that
          helps readers see which professions are more likely to be transformed by AI.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- From National to Local: Durham Region -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>From National Patterns to Durham Region</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than talking about AI in abstract national terms only, the project brings the story down to Durham
          Region. We connected the occupation-level exposure data with local spatial data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Durham Region’s Business Directory (GeoJSON)</strong> – providing the location of registered
            businesses across the region.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2016 Census Dissemination Areas (GeoJSON)</strong> – offering demographic variables such as
            working-age population and seniors, along with neighborhood boundaries.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Through several map iterations, we moved from simple county outlines to richer layers showing population,
          business density, and eventually AI exposure. The final maps illustrate where Robo might “start eating first”
          if he arrives in Durham: areas with many businesses and a concentration of highly exposed occupations.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Story Structure & Visual Design -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Story Structure &amp; Visual Design</h2>
        <p>
          The story follows a classic three-act structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 1 – Introduction.</strong> Robo is introduced as an emerging AI entity. We explain who he is,
            what he eats (data and tasks), and how his hunger grows as systems become more powerful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 2 – Conflict.</strong> Once Robo is “fully developed”, he arrives in Durham Region and begins
            feeding on the jobs that are most exposed to AI, illustrated through maps and occupation categories.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 3 – Conclusion.</strong> The story ends by asking what this means for workers today: who is
            most at risk, what types of skills are more resilient, and what kinds of support or adaptation strategies
            are needed for midlife workers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Visually, we leaned into a horror aesthetic: dark textures, window-like frames with “X” close buttons, and
          glitchy typography that evokes old computer interfaces. This style reinforces the unsettling feeling of
          watching Robo grow while keeping the data and maps readable.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Collaboration & Tools -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>Collaboration &amp; Tools</h2>
        <p>
          RoboStory was developed collaboratively using:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Miro</strong> – for brainstorming themes, characters, datasets, and delivery methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Canva (Website mode)</strong> – to assemble the visual narrative as a scrolling web experience.</li>
          <li><strong> GIS/mapping tools</strong> – to create the sequence of map iterations from simple boundaries to AI-exposure maps.</li>
          <li><strong>Spreadsheet and coding tools</strong> – for basic processing of the Statistics Canada and local datasets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The project required aligning different skills in the group: data research, mapping, visual design, copywriting,
          and narrative structure.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Reflection -->
      <article class="case-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This final project brought together many elements from the course: scrollytelling, mapping, visual hierarchy,
          and collaborative design. Personally, I learned how to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>translate a complex policy and labour-market topic into a character-driven narrative,</li>
          <li>connect national-level datasets with local geospatial data to make the story feel concrete,</li>
          <li>coordinate a multi-person workflow where different people own different parts of the story.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          RoboStory sits alongside the comic (Assignment 1), the historical StoryMap (Assignment 2), and the concert
          infographic (Assignment 3) as a complementary example of how I approach data storytelling: mixing strong visual
          themes with solid data and clear structure.
